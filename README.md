#Backend-with-fetch

the code for this can be found in expApp.js which showcases the books and expDataStore.js which fetches the books. 
the json library is provided in this file "booksdb.json"  and im fetching on port 4000. 

You are able to see all current books(only the id is shown, name and other info could be had by just coding .name on expApp.js line 61), and create new book with hardcoded values. u can also search the library for a book by id, page needs to be reloaded tho cause the search event removes all books from the current array.
